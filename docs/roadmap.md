# Roadmap

Phases are ordered so that each one is verifiable on its own. Nothing after
phase 0 is implemented yet.

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding ✅

Monorepo layout, Gradle build with convention plugins, version catalogue,
module boundaries, repository documentation. `./gradlew build` is green.

## Phase 1 — Loader core ✅

The loader running against `testing/harness`, a fake game, so none of this needs
Minecraft to be tested. `./gradlew :test-harness:runDemo` shows it end to end.

- `fenix.mod.json` parsing and validation ✅
- Mod discovery from a mods directory ✅
- Semantic version constraint solving and dependency ordering ✅
- A child-first classloader with a transformation hook ✅
- The `@Mod` annotation, the `fenix-processor` index, and lifecycle dispatch ✅

## Phase 2 — Launching real Minecraft ✅

- `fenix-installer`: a version manifest and launcher profile written into
  `.minecraft` ✅ — the profile inherits from vanilla, so the launcher builds
  the classpath and Fenix only swaps the main class
- Locating the game jar and detecting the side ✅ — plus the game version read
  from the jar's `version.json`, which feeds the `minecraft` builtin
- A dry-run mode that proves the classpath is right without opening a window ✅
  — `--fenix.dryRun`, verified against the real 26.2 client jar

## Phase 3 — Mixin ✅

- A Fenix mixin service backed by the loader's classloader ✅
- `mixins` in mod metadata, and the shared `fr.d4emon.fenix.mixin.*` root ✅
- No refmaps: the game is unobfuscated ✅ — mixins target Minecraft by string,
  so nothing needs the game on its compile classpath
- Lifecycle mixins fire `onRegister`/`onInit` from inside the game, and
  `testmod`'s title mixin is the visible proof

## Phase 4 — The Gradle plugin ✅

`fr.d4emon.fenix.dev`, which is what makes Fenix usable by anyone else.

- Download the client from piston-meta, plus vanilla libraries ✅ — the client
  is cached and SHA-1 verified; libraries are ordinary Gradle dependencies
- `runClient` ✅ — launches through the loader with the mod in `run/mods`,
  reusing the vanilla launcher's assets
- `runServer` ✅ — un-bundles Mojang's server jar and launches it, server side
- `genSources` via Vineflower ✅ — decompiles Minecraft for navigation
- IDE run configurations ✅ — written for IntelliJ during Gradle sync

`examples/example-mod` is a complete Fenix mod whose whole build file is
`id("fr.d4emon.fenix.dev")`: it compiles against real Minecraft and runs
through Fenix.

Third parties can use it: the artifacts are published to a public Maven
repository (see below), so a mod's whole build file is one plugin line.

## Phase 5 — The API 🚧

`fenix-api-event`, then `registry`, then `resource`. Each one is a real mod that
proves the loader works.

- **Events** ✅ — `Event`/`CancellableEvent` carrying a context record,
  priorities, first-class unsubscription, lock-free dispatch. Client and server
  ticks, server lifecycle, and cancellable block break/use on both sides.
- **Registry** ✅ — a deferred `Registrar` with `Holder`s and fluent builders,
  absorbing the vanilla bookkeeping that a mod otherwise skips and crashes on.
  Blocks and items today.
- **Resources** ✅ — every mod jar is handed to the game as a resource pack, so
  its models, textures and translations are actually read.

Still missing, and wanted: **creative tabs** (content is currently only
reachable with `/give`), more events (player, entity, world), and more
registries (entities, block entities, sounds).

## Phase 6 — Ember ✅

Assets and data generated from Java, as a set of providers:
`EmberModelProvider`, `EmberLanguageProvider`, `EmberLootTableProvider`,
`EmberRecipeProvider` and `EmberTagsProvider.BlockTagsProvider`/`.ItemTagsProvider`.
Run with `gradlew ember`; output lands in `src/main/generated`.

Textures are the one thing not generated.

## Phase 7 — Networking

Typed custom payloads, then registry sync — detection and a clear refusal
first, never live remapping.

## Phase 8 — Commands and config

Brigadier registration, and typed configuration backed by records — something
Fabric leaves to third-party libraries.

## Phase 9 — Shipping

- Publish to a public Maven repository ✅ — a plain Maven repo on GitHub Pages,
  free and login-free to consume; see [publishing.md](publishing.md)
- The website, with generated API documentation
- A conformance suite broad enough to trust a release
- Maven Central, once the API stabilises
