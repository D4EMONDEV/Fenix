# Roadmap

Phases are ordered so that each one is verifiable on its own. Nothing after
phase 0 is implemented yet.

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding ✅

Monorepo layout, Gradle build with convention plugins, version catalogue,
module boundaries, repository documentation. `./gradlew build` is green.

## Phase 1 — Loader core ✅

The loader running against `testing/harness`, a fake game, so none of this needs
Minecraft to be tested. `./gradlew :test-harness:runDemo` shows it end to end.

- `fenix.mod.json` parsing and validation ✅
- Mod discovery from a mods directory ✅
- Semantic version constraint solving and dependency ordering ✅
- A child-first classloader with a transformation hook ✅
- The `@Mod` annotation, the `fenix-processor` index, and lifecycle dispatch ✅

## Phase 2 — Launching real Minecraft ✅

- `fenix-installer`: a version manifest and launcher profile written into
  `.minecraft` ✅ — the profile inherits from vanilla, so the launcher builds
  the classpath and Fenix only swaps the main class
- Locating the game jar and detecting the side ✅ — plus the game version read
  from the jar's `version.json`, which feeds the `minecraft` builtin
- A dry-run mode that proves the classpath is right without opening a window ✅
  — `--fenix.dryRun`, verified against the real 26.2 client jar

## Phase 3 — Mixin ✅

- A Fenix mixin service backed by the loader's classloader ✅
- `mixins` in mod metadata, and the shared `fr.d4emon.fenix.mixin.*` root ✅
- No refmaps: the game is unobfuscated ✅ — mixins target Minecraft by string,
  so nothing needs the game on its compile classpath
- Lifecycle mixins fire `onRegister`/`onInit` from inside the game, and
  `testmod`'s title mixin is the visible proof

## Phase 4 — The Gradle plugin

`fr.d4emon.fenix.dev`, which is what makes Fenix usable by anyone else.

- Download the client from piston-meta, plus vanilla libraries
- `genSources` via Vineflower
- `runClient`, `runServer`
- IDE run configurations

## Phase 5 — The API

`fenix-api-event`, then `registry`, then `resource`. Each one is a real mod that
proves the loader works.

## Phase 6 — Ember

Assets and data generated from Java: models, translations, loot tables, recipes,
tags.

## Phase 7 — Networking

Typed custom payloads, then registry sync — detection and a clear refusal
first, never live remapping.

## Phase 8 — Commands and config

## Phase 9 — Shipping

- Publish to a public Maven repository, which is the real blocker for third
  party mod authors
- The website, with generated API documentation
- A conformance suite broad enough to trust a release
